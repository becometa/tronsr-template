# Karol 'becometa' Sta≈Ñczak
TRON supporter, believer and holder since late November '17. 

I'm not a developer nor a code programer. 
I would describe myself rather as a:
* community manager
* text writer
* information translator
* forum enthusiast (able to build, administer and maintain forums from scratch)
  * Kryptowaluty.org.pl owner, mainly targeted at the Polish part of the crypto community.
* customer (user) focused adviser and helper
* and most importantly blockchain technology and TRON believer.

## My contributions to the TRON ecosystem:
- [x] I've translated nearly 90% of TRON Docs to Polish
- [x] I'm maintaining a Polish TRX subforum at my own [forum](https://kryptowaluty.org.pl/trx/)
- [x] I'm informing the Polish community about crypto and TRON related events, news on sites such as: [Bitcoin.pl](https://forum.bitcoin.pl/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=29263), [Wykop.pl](https://www.wykop.pl/ludzie/BeCometA/) and [Steemit](https://steemit.com/@becometa)
- [x] I've created and published this graphics: ![TRON Timeline of events](https://kryptowaluty.org.pl/pic/poradnik/tron-trx-june-2018-kryptowaluty-org-pl-half.png)
